                I'm slowly getting exponentially sick of manually copying and pasting the
                header and footer of these <code>html</code> pages.
            </p>
            <p>
                <i>But why don't you use php or some framework?</i><br>
                <strong>BECAUSE</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
                It's overhead which I don't need in this static website, which probably nobody
                is ever going to look at for longer than 5 seconds, therefore making it an even
                bigger mound of salt on the figurative injury of wanting to grab someones attention
                and entertain them (and perhaps educate about a thing or two).
            </p>
            <p>
                So, just a few hours ago, I noticed my web server had a <code>cgi-bin</code>
                directory, and that gave me some devious ideas...
            </p>
            <p>
                An old, arcane, obscure and now obsolete way to do something which has been near perfected
                in the previous 20 years? Sign me the fuck up since there is no JavaScript.
            </p>
            <p>
                Therefore, take this as... an announcement. Great things are coming. <br>
                Hopefully. <br>
                If I remember to work on it once my exams are finished. <br>
                And if I even get to make the aforementioned hackery work.
            </p>
